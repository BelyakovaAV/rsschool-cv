# About Me
Currently I work in the safebox field as a customer service manager. But something new rarely appears in this work, I understand that I want to constantly learn something. And now I see for myself such prospects in the field of programming.
Experience in this field is minimal. I want to improve my skills as a specialist, I am set up for professional growth and active independent learning of new things. I'm ready to do an internship!
> There is a huge motivation to explore a new field of activity and in the future I see my goal to become a *project manager*.

_My strengths:_
* Quick learner
* Full immersion in the essence of the problems
* Diligence
* Team playing
* Вeveloped emotional intelligence
